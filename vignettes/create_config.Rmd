The configuration object includes the customizable initialization, observer, speciation, dispersal, evolution and ecology functions. Altogether, these six functions are applied as defined in the simulation engine. The possibility to customize these functions confers the high flexibility of *gen3sis* in terms of including a wide range of theoretical knowledge. Additionally, the configuration object lists the model settings, i.e. the ecological traits considered in the simulation: whether a random seed is used; allowing simulation reproducibility; start and end times of the simulation; and rules about aborting the simulation, including the maximum global or local species number permitted. 

This vignette will guide you trough the config input object. It can be either an R object or a file, that can be easily shared and modified.

Here we will:

[1. **Create an empty config**](#create) using the *write_config_skeleton* function. 

[2. **Explain an example config**](#explore) using the config from [introduction.html](this vignette) vignette.

[3. **Modify a config**](#modify) from within R.




```{r setup}
library(gen3sis)
```

## 1. Create an empty config {#create}


In order to create an empty config, we use the function *write_config_skeleton* and define the output location. For that we have to define where the empty config will be stored.

```{r eval=TRUE}
# get data path
datapath <- system.file(file.path("extdata", "EmptyConfig"), package="gen3sis")
# set config_empty.R file path
config_file_path <- file.path(datapath, "EmptyConfig", "config_empty.R")
```

And then create an empty config.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#writes out a config skeleton
write_config_skeleton(config_file_path)
```
This is how the config_empty.R looks like. We present them by main areas and each part is described briefly. For more information see next session.

Note that the main core functions have stop warnings by default, this forces the configuration to be edited according to the rules and assumptions (model) that is to be created. You can do this from scratch or by modifying an existing config.


## 2. Explain example config {#explore}

Here we will go bit by bit of the config used at the [introduction.html](this vignette) vignette. We will follow the structure presented above.


### **Content of config_.empty_worldcenter.R**

### ***Settings***
We start our simulation with the first avaiable timestep and end it a the latest available timestep at the landscape, thus *start_time* and *end_time* are set to NA. We limit the maximum total number of species alive in a simulation to 50000 with *max_number_of_species* and the maximum number of species with one cell to 10000 with *max_number_of_coexisting_species*. Like so, we stop simulations that could possible go off hand and generate too many species. We define which traits we will consider in our simulation with *traits_names*, in our example, species only have a dispersal ability and a optimum temperature traits. For our model to work, we normalize the environmental values, according to the range informed at *environmental_ranges*.

>```{r eval=FALSE}
random_seed = 666
start_time = NA
end_time = NA
max_number_of_species = 50000
max_number_of_coexisting_species = 10000
trait_names = c("temp",  "dispersal")
environmental_ranges = list("temp" = c(-45, 55), "area"=c(101067, 196949), "prec"=c(1,0.5))
```

### ***Observer***
In our observer function we save the species and plot the richness. Like so, plots are printed as the simulation progresses and also saved inside the plot folder inside output.

>```{r eval=FALSE}
end_of_timestep_observer = function(data, vars, config){
  save_species()
  plot_richness(data$all_species, data$landscape)
}
```

Combined plots can be generated inside the observer function as for example:

>```{r eval=FALSE}
end_of_timestep_observer = function(data, vars, config){
    par(mfrow=c(2,3))
    plot_raster_single(data$landscape$environment[,"temp"], data$landscape, "temp", NA)
    plot_raster_single(data$landscape$environment[,"prec"], data$landscape, "prec", NA)
    plot_raster_single(data$landscape$environment[,"area"], data$landscape, "area", NA)
    plot_richness(data$all_species, data$landscape)
    plot_species_presence(data$all_species[[1]], data$landscape)
    plot(0,type='n',axes=FALSE,ann=FALSE)
    mtext("STATUS",1)
}
```

### ***Initialization***
The initial abundance of the ancestor species as well as the abundance of species on newly colonized cells is 1. We set one single ancestor species spread across the entire globe, i.e. between longitudes [-180, 180] and latitudes [-90, 90]. We set the **temp** trait of each population of the initial species to the environmental temperature. This means, that each population is adapted to the local conditions, as we will see later on the ecology function. Dispersal is set to one, since it is not ranging. The function *create_ancestor_species* is expected to return a list of new species, i.e. the ancestor(s) one(s).

>```{r eval=FALSE}
initial_abundance = 1
create_ancestor_species <- function(landscape, config) {
  range <- c(-180, 180, -90, 90)
  co <- landscape$coordinates
  selection <- co[, "x"] >= range[1] &
    co[, "x"] <= range[2] &
    co[, "y"] >= range[3] &
    co[, "y"] <= range[4]
  initial_cells <- rownames(co)[selection]
  new_species <- create_species(initial_cells, config)
  #set local adaptation to max optimal temp equals local temp
  new_species$traits[ , "temp"] <- landscape$environment[,"temp"]
  new_species$traits[ , "dispersal"] <- 1
  return(list(new_species))
}
```

### ***Core Processes***

#### ***Dispersal***
The dispersal of all species is the same and is stochastic, following a weibull distribution with shape 6 and scale 999. For different dispersal between species, the dispersal trait should be used. Moreover, dispersal can be made deterministic by making the function return a fix value. 

>```{r eval=FALSE}
get_dispersal_values <- function(n, species, landscape, config) {
  values <- rweibull(n, shape = 6, scale = 999)
  return(values) }
```

This is the histogram of 100 drwans from the dispersal function used abover.

>```{r eval=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.2}
n <- 100
hist(rweibull(n, shape = 6, scale = 999))
```

### ***Speciation***

>```{r eval=FALSE}
```

# threshold for genetic distance after which a speciation event takes place.
divergence_threshold = NULL
# factor by which the divergence is increased between geographically isolated population.
# can also be a matrix between the different population clusters.
get_divergence_factor <- function(species, cluster_indices, landscape, config) {
  stop("calculate divergence factor here")
}
### ***Evolution***

>```{r eval=FALSE}
```

# mutate the traits of a species and return the new traits matrix.
apply_evolution <- function(species, cluster_indices, landscape, config) {
  stop("mutate species traits here")
}
###  ***Ecology***

>```{r eval=FALSE}
```

# called for every cell with all occurring species, this function calculates abundances and/or who survives for each sites
# returns a vector of abundances.
# set the abundance to 0 for every species supposed to die.
apply_ecology <- function(abundance, traits, environment, config) {
  stop("calculate species abundances and deaths here")
}






The configuration object (Figure 1 B), also required by the function contains the biological parameters that describe the rules of evolution, as well as technical parameters, such as seeding. The function “write_config_skeleton (“my_config.R”) creates a skeleton config file, which can then be changed by the user. 

The initialization function creates the ancestor species at the start of the simulation. Users can define the number of ancestor species, their distribution within the ancient landscape and their trait values. With the observer function, changes over time in any abiotic or biotic information of the virtual world can be recorded by defining the outputs that are saved at specified time steps, and results can be saved and plotted in real-time as the model runs. 


## 3. Modify a config {#modify}

A configuration object can be modified by editing a file or the config object in R. Here we will load the config_worldcenter.R as an R object and modify it's random seed.

```{r eval=TRUE}
# get data path
datapath <- system.file(file.path("extdata", "WorldCenter"), package="gen3sis")
# creates config object from config file
config_object <- create_input_config(file.path(datapath, "config/config_worldcenter.R"))
# modify random seed
config_object$gen3sis$general$random_seed <- 2020
```

Like so, functions and parameters can be conveniently changed and simulated in gen3sis. Remember that *run_simulation* works either with a path to a config file or config object, so we can run the old and the new modified config.

```{r eval=F}
# run simulation by indicating config file path
sim_old <- run_simulation(config = file.path(datapath, "config/config_worldcenter.R"), 
               landscape = file.path(datapath, "landscape"))

# run simulation by indicating config object
sim_new <- run_simulation(config = config_object, 
               landscape = file.path(datapath, "landscape"))

```
